1. Two Sum
- Given an array of integers and an integer (target), return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
- You can return the answer in any order
- Example: input - nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9; output - [0,1] because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9
